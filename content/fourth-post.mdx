So, here's something that makes me feel old: React celebrated its 10th birthday this year!

In the decade since React was first introduced to a bewildered dev community, it’s gone through several evolutions. The React team has not been shy when it comes to radical changes: if they discover a better solution to a problem, they'll run with it.

A couple of months ago, the React team unveiled React Server Components, the latest paradigm shift. For the first time ever, React components can run exclusively on the server.

There's been so much friggin’ confusion about this online. Lots of folks have lots of questions around what this is, how it works, what the benefits are, and how it fits together with things like Server Side Rendering.

I've been doing a lot of experimentation with React Server Components, and I've answered a lot of my own questions. I have to admit, I'm way more excited about this stuff than I expected to be. It's really cool!

So, my goal today is to help demystify this stuff for you, to answer a lot of the questions you might have about React Server Components!

## A quick primer on Server Side Rendering
